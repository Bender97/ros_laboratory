# LeGO-LOAM-SR

This code is a fork from [LeGO-LOAM-BOR](https://github.com/facontidavide/LeGO-LOAM-BOR) to migrate [LeGO-LOAM](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM) algorithm to ROS2.

This code does not modify and/or improve the original [LeGO-LOAM](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM) algorithm.

## 1. About the original LeGO-LOAM

[LeGO-LOAM](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM) contains code for a lightweight and ground optimized lidar odometry and mapping (LeGO-LOAM) system for ROS compatible UGVs.
The system takes in point cloud from a Velodyne VLP-16 Lidar (palced horizontal) and it outputs 6D pose estimation in real-time. A demonstration of the system can be found here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3tz_ftHV48

## 2. Dependencies

- [ROS2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/) (tested with dashing)
- [gtsam](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/releases) (Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping library, 4.0.0-alpha2)
  ```
  wget -O ~/Downloads/gtsam.zip https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/archive/4.0.0-alpha2.zip
  cd ~/Downloads/ && unzip gtsam.zip -d ~/Downloads/
  cd ~/Downloads/gtsam-4.0.0-alpha2/
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  sudo make install
  ```

## 3. Compile

You can use the following commands to download and compile the package.

```
cd ~/dev_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/eperdices/LeGO-LOAM-SR.git
cd ..
colcon build
```

## 4. The system

LeGO-LOAM is speficifally optimized for a horizontally placed lidar on a ground vehicle. It assumes there is always a ground plane in the scan.

The package performs segmentation before feature extraction.

Lidar odometry performs two-step Levenberg Marquardt optimization to get 6D transformation.

## 5. New sensor and configuration

To customize the behavior of the algorithm or to use a lidar different from VLP-16, edit the file **config/loam_config.yaml**.

One important thing to keep in mind is that our current implementation for range image projection is only suitable for sensors that have evenly distributed channels.
If you want to use our algorithm with Velodyne VLP-32c or HDL-64e, you need to write your own implementation for such projection.

If the point cloud is not projected properly, you will lose many points and performance.

**The IMU has been remove from the original LeGO-LOAM code.**

## 6. Run the package

System can be started using the following command:

```
ros2 launch lego_loam_sr run.launch.py
```

Some sample bags can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/jackal_dataset_20170608).

### 6.1 Run ROS1 rosbag

To use rosbags from ROS1, you need to use a [bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge) between ROS1 and ROS2.

Play rosbag using ROS1:

```
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
roscore &
rosbag play *.bag --clock --topic /velodyne_points
```

Create the bridge in another terminal:

```
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge
```

Finally, run ROS2 code:

```
source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash
source ~/dev_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch lego_loam_sr run.launch.py
```

### 6.2 New data-set

This dataset, [Stevens data-set](https://github.com/TixiaoShan/Stevens-VLP16-Dataset), is captured using a Velodyne VLP-16, which is mounted on an UGV - Clearpath Jackal, on Stevens Institute of Technology campus.
The VLP-16 rotation rate is set to 10Hz. This data-set features over 20K scans and many loop-closures.
